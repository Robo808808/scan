+ Without App Changes | Impact
Connections tied to a single DB host | Failures = application outages
Non-deterministic writes (e.g., timestamp + sequence mixes) | TAC cannot replay → errors during failover
Connection pools not configured for FAN | Failover takes **minutes** instead of seconds
No failover testing in UAT | Outages still require “war rooms”
}
