+ Today | Desired State (Target)
Apps connect to a **host or instance** | Apps connect to **services** (logical, portable)
Users see errors during failover or maintenance | Failovers are **invisible** to users (TAC replay)
Outages cause operational escalations | Database events handled **automatically** (FSFO)
Patch windows require downtime or user impact | Patching done **online** (Transient Logical / rolling upgrades)
Responsibility unclear during incidents | Clear separation: DB handles resilience, Apps handle logical workflow only
