+ Area | What Needs to Change | Why
Connection Strings | Must use **services**, not hostnames or SIDs | So sessions can move between nodes/standbys
Connection Pools | Must allow **transparent reconnect** | So failover does not break user sessions
Transaction Behavior | Should avoid **non-deterministic writes** inside business ops | So TAC can safely replay during failover
Error Handling | Replace “connection dropped” logic with **retry/continue** semantics | To avoid needless service disruption
Deployment & Testing | Include **failover drills** in UAT | Confidence + no surprises in prod
